## Data

The data for bookmarks and favorite applications is stored in two separate JavaScript files: "data.js" and "favapps.js," respectively. The data is represented as arrays of objects, where each object contains information about a specific website or favorite application.

- "data.js" contains an array of website objects, with properties such as link, category (cat), and name.
- "favapps.js" contains an array of favorite application objects, with properties like link, category (cat), and name.

To update the bookmarks or favorite applications, modify the data in these files accordingly.
